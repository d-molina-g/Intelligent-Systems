35WGZWYI7HOXJSGPVWZIS6RWGM	My nickname is an abbreviation for "Not Minnesota Nice." Minnesota Nice refers to people who are so overly polite that they never confront anyone, rarely debate anything -- and often get taken advantage of by scammers, telemarketers, etc. A lot of Minnesotans really are like that -- hence the stereotype. But not ME! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am also a professional writer/researcher (my typos are due to dyslexia, not ignorance of spelling!) I live with my wife on a small hobby farm in northern Minnesota. We live on a farm with 2 dogs, 14 cats, 5 geese, a flock of chickens and a tarantula. Plus lots of wildlifez.

3DJUSRFSAHSWE72DSJWAOXB6BY	"He who would sacrifice Liberty for a little temporary security deserves neither ""~B.Franklin"" <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am all about social justice, the way things are and the way that they're supposed to be, but just like so many people we all know, until now I've really never known what to do about it, I had come to the realization that the officials sworn to serve and protect the people of The United States have no real loyalty to us, at least not to those of us without money. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Then I decided there has to be a way to change the fact that corporations have more of a say than the people, after all this is America, man. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Now, I'm all about being grateful for what we do have and finding ways to make things better and to do that we have to start from where we're at and turn this country from its free fall into greed and corruption. The way to begin changing these things may be to start focusing on putting out positive energy and the way you do that is through your thoughts & actions.

3RDBQKNAISOQFTVIJ3JHUZU5LI	I'm a cynical and surly 29 year old gal that’s anxiously waiting out these last two months of my twenties while living in Orange County, CA (currently). I've lived here for 5 years now, which is pretty amazing since I spent most of my early twenties as a vagabond. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In the time I have lived in SoCal I have been in a plethora of bands playing the bass guitar and doing backup vocals. I enjoy traveling all around the world and this beautiful state. There are so many different types of things to do in California and I feel so lucky to have had such a long stay here. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> What I aspire to do in my years to come would be: <br> <br/> Standup Comedy, Write a book, Have my own sitcom (which is really easy nowadays with all the reality crap that’s popping up), visit family members that I have not seen in a really long time, continue to work on my own music, stop thinking about how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop, etc. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In a nutshell, that’s me.

NPQ7S5KLGXLT34PQJV3HJODOEU	I am a 63 yr old. I was a widow for six years and met my current husband online from Texas. I raised four sons, Steven, Matt, Michael and Daniel, all of whom are very talented, artistically and musically. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My husband and I both work near several reservations steeped in native culture and arts. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am a worship leader and also involved with drama, dance and teaching music and Bible at our church. I love to write poetry, articles and songs. I enjoy gardening and feeding hummingbirds when they arrive. My husband is very supportive of my ministry and I hope one day he'll pick up the trumpet and play in the church. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My husband had an accident before he even got here. A vulture made its way to his windshield and he veered to avoid getting glass in his face. His truck was totalled and my friends and I went 10 hours to Texas to pick him and his trailer up.

My designs are for sale at my web site: <a href="http://www.beadaciousjewelry.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beadaciousjewelry.com</a> I hope you'll take a look at it sometime and tell me what you think. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm a born and raised Steeler girl. I've got coal and steel running through my veins. I live in Illinois now, after an 11 month stint in New York. Now that's a place I'd go back to in a New York minute. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My significant other, Ted and our two cats, Bristol and Charlotte moved to Illinois in 2001. If you're a race fan you'll recognize the names of our cats. If not, well then you'll just think they're cute names. You'd think with their being New York kitties, that they'd have a New York attitude, wrong, they're very chicken and run at the least bit of movement or sound. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Just thought I'd let you know who I am and where I'm from.

I'm very proud to be Mexican! :] <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm a bit cynical & don't have high hope, but I still like to laugh and have fun with my friends. Hugs are still my favorite! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm not sure in true, life-long love really exists, for a lot of reasons, but I still believe in the love you have for your friends & family. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> It's in my nature to worry, and I think too much. That also means that I easily feel guilty. I never leave home without three vital things: My Book, My iPod and my Sarcasm. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Oh yeah, I'm fascinated by the media. I find it completely stupid, and it's usually (like boys =P) the root of our problems. 99.9% is fake and I hate what it's done to our world. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Oh, and in one of my "Best Answers", I end it with "I know I helped" That is an error! I meant to say "I hope I helped". <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My favorite subjects are Music and Psychology. Water (Sea/Ocean) and fish are my biggest fear.

KHQLAL42PP35GFL73ZXNXC7VVY	USMC Vet living in MI. Happily married and 100% supportive of this country. I hold no comments back when defending the USA, love it or leave it. Really I'm not anti-anything, more like pro-mind your our business, but if you put it out there then be prepared. <br> <br/> I'm a religious skeptic open to all views but I believe good people are good people regardless. I'm bluntly, if not harshly, honest, A Type A hypocrisy hating personality. <br> <br/> If I don't know you and you add me I may block you. Yes free speech = sacred right to me, but it's also my right to not have to listen to idiots 10z0% of my day. Yes I listen to both sides but some of you are not only truly ignorant but also borderline psychotic, hence why I block some members. That's also the reason I turn off email at times, it really gets old. <br> <br/> If you're expecting daily jargon from me you're looking in the wrong direction.

KDR577COD6X65QUZVQTCH4B2ZQ	Well at 10 a.m. October 25, 2011 it looks like Harold Miller the elected President of Sunnydale Tenants Association in 2009 of San Francisco Housing Authority is the last person to file his papers to run as a candidate for mayor of San Francisco as a write-in , with 16 candidates on the ballet and 7 write-ins, we asked Mr Miller why is he running? And the answer we got was not short and sweet, like the other politicians that are running. "San Francisco is not fun and fair and as mayor I will make sure the folks of San Francisco will be happy to live here ,and that includes the 12,000 homeless and future homeless when the" BIG QUACK "comes! Like my plan for "Camp Freedom, on the corner of 16th and 7th and Hubbell st where we can house and cloth and feed and make sure they get all medical help and medications. Well we wish Mr Miller good luck .

KXJ55VQGOADQPEUQB53N2QCRJM	Hey, everyone! Okay, so in case you were wondering, I'm a fourteen-year-old girl that lives in Kansas. I enjoy cheerleading and reading, both my favorite past-times, whenever I feel like it, anyways...I have shoulder-length brown hair that is so dark it looks almost black, and is occasionally mistaken as such. I've got really dark blue eyes, almost sapphire in color-really weird, I know. I'm, like, 5'2'' and nowhere near getting any taller, and I really like most of the songs that Enrique Iglesias sings. The only spanish ones, though, are Amigo Vulnerable (tired of being sorry), and Alguien Soy Yo (somebody's me). They also have the songs in English. Kissen 925 is my favorite radio station and my favorite movie...well, let's just say it hasn't come out yet. Freaky, I know, but they are basing it off of my favorite book, Twilight, by Stephenie Meyer-read it!!!-and it looks awsome. except for the spider monkey scene. Who like spider monkeys, anyway? Sorry for all spider monkey lovers!!!

MXGW4IDPVGZUCFQRNTMDTEJLBY	well, for starters, our government, for instance is more concerned about spending (literally) billions per day to fight a war that reaps no benefits to the United States whether it is "lost" or "won." And second, the emphasis in our country is on making the rich richer. As sad as it sounds, that's the way it is, and until public policy tells us otherwise, it will continue on that way. The best way to start to fix the problem is to erase the stain that has been left on our nation by the current administration for the better part of a decade. That may not solve all of the problems, but it will at least give the poorest 99.9% of the population an opportunity for better lives.

My skills and design ideas though similar simply because I was taught to do things in certain ways for certain reasons are both like and unlike my mentors work.

I also had another New Hamshire red, but she died of pneumonia back in February (R.I.P. Cheddar). My first batch of chickens were a bantam pearl white leghorn (R.I.P. Jade) and a Rhode Island red rooster (Cappucinno) and hen (Poco). I've loved chickens ever since that first Easter and I love educating people about them and helping them start out their own flock. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Feel free to add me to your contacts if you love chickens!

Who above reproach was honest and who LOVED God more than life itself. I say this... because once I was blind but now I see (methaphorically speaking) :) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Blessings in our Lord Christ Jesus & Thankyou for reading my profile..

SY5FWPOLA3X52CZKDPUM34PMBE	My interests are good friends, movies, television, the internet, music, food, clothing, books, comic books, drawing, writing, and video games. I hate school and homework. <br> <br/> My favorite subjects are English, Lunch, and History. I like Lunch because you get to talk to your friends and I like English and History, not because they're interesting, but because I'm good at them. I like to draw or write when I'm bored. I'll draw anything. I mostly write things down to remind myself about something, or to get things out of my head so I feel better afterwards. I don't own any comic books, but I know a lot about superheroes from Marvel, DC, and some others. I mostly like fiction books. My favorite books are Are You There God? It's Me Margaret, If I Had One Wish..., and the Goosebumps series. I like Mudd, Bongo, and Arizona jeans. I love food and going to the movies. I like pop, rap/hip hop, r&b, and rock. I like finding new websites. My favorite channels are VH1, Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon.

I attend school full-time and work part-time while; unfortunately, still living with my parents. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I also own my own small programming company, now known as LondyTech.

(i.e. C++, C#, Lua, PHP, Perl, Java, etc.) Be sure to keep an eye out for the latest updates. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> What more is there to say about me? I love working with computers and I've done it all my life. I can solve just about any problem I come across, and I am always eager to help others. I have just recently built my own PC, and it works better than I could have ever asked for. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Despite the fact that I am working part-time, I am still looking for employment in a field that would better suit my career goals in life.

JHEX3OA7LZL4SG3CZLQM2Z6E7I	I grew up the orphan son of a third generation Caribbean yak herder.

I got an Ivy League college education and made a fortune when the government sent me 1.7 billion dollars to bail out the dental floss manufacturing plant that I owned. Life is good!

EPJMXPCKFIJEPYDKC372RWXE6A	The beauty of a great photograph and the beauty <br> <br/> <br> <br/> of an exotic car stirs emotions. I have the pleasure of being able to spend time enjoying both. I grew up in Michigan near the Motor City. After attending the University of zNevada as a music major, I joined the Marine Corps as a combat correspondent. During more than seven years as a dedicated Marine, I won many publishing awards for photography, writing, and editing. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I met my wife (of nearly 20 years), Barbra, while serving in California. My career also took us to Japan and Washington, D.C. Following the service I started my own graphic design company, and worked as a technical research assistant at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> What led me to the car biz is this: I love cars and love to serve and to solve problems. I have raced stock cars and sports cars and competed in off-road events, as well as been a pit official for the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring.

I've tried Balut...Half developed duck egg. Didn't really care for it. Tried closing my eyes (Which usually helps), but when you start chewing, you either get bones, beak, or feathers. It's something you gotta try once in your life. Fear factor has featured it once. <br> <br/> I'm in Hawaii, there's a large cultural diversity. Many good food with good people.

EKXKWTFTFTRBTJB22DIZ36B5HU	I'm a snowman, what would you possibly want to know? I like to chill out, stand in people's front yard with my broom and look cool in my top hat and scarf. I am an exhibitionist because I refuse to wear any sort of pants. I also have a huge, long carrot that I enjoy showing off. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> But it isn't always that great. I was once stuck in a traffic jam in the middle of downtown Los Angeles. Needless to say, the air conditioning wasn't enough to keep me cool. Not only did I melt, but I also lost about 300 pounds of snow in 10 minutes. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I also spend way too much time at the Kingdom of Loathing. I only play it while in my igloo, because Santa tracks my internet usage while at work. Santa's a real taskmaster.

EICPC4T47NJYHUMB5ZY7NTRZVU	I'm 22 yrs old. I live in St. Louis, MO. Tryin' to take it easy right now at this point in my life, and concentrate on taking care of some peripheral issue, so I can be back in school in the fall and direct my undivided attention to it. Still not sure what I want to major in, I have a wide range of interests in subjects such as psychology, philosophy, etymology, and many disciplines of science. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'd be remiss not to mention that I'm a Christain, and a content one at that. It's virtually impossible for me to accurately describe the peace God has imparted to me since returning to Him. It's far better than running from Him and relying on myself, and living for myself only. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I've also taken a liking to Christian Apologetics. That's really the only reason I'm on Answers. I'm determined to expose myself to any and all arguments against Christianity.

5MEM4GP7STZEOSO45XZSRWHMEA	I currently live in China studying Chinese, Chinese politics, and focusing on Chinese military development. I'm a political science/history buff, who can't wait to get back to DC so I can see the madness that is going to be Obama's inauguration. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Politically, I'm somewhere in the middle. I refuse to register with a party as I believe, much like Washington did, that our two party system is a hindrance to the effectiveness of our government.

5GZAYTIHUGTNL2X3SBYNUUOXFU	Hi, I'm Benji, the guy on the left side of the picture. Was born and raised in San Diego, California. There are two overarching loves in my life. One is for writing, the other is for working in the great outdoors. Combining those two loves has been a very meaningful and rewarding experience. For me, there's nothing better than spending a morning working hard with my hands in nature, and spending the afternoon writing. Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed this relationship best: <br> <br/> <br> <br/> "The charming landscape which I saw this morning, was indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is a property in the horizon that no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the best of these men's farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title."

5DJAYIBF4U5PMSN4IE43G5YTXU	Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Surah Al Baqara 2:255 Ayat Al-kursi <br> <br/> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVryWjoGquM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVryWjoGq...</a>

VARGEYIQ55VJDT57RV7BCUZU5M	Lived in LA long enough to be an expert. Chose the name because some questions just deserve a DUH! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I regularly copy & paste from my own original answers, because the same questions keep getting asked. If a question is repeated enough, I compose a thorough answer and save it for later. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I genuinely like helping people. But consider that the advice you get here is free. If you don't want a little attitude with your answers, then hire a professional (travel agent, realtor, rental agent, etc), and THEY can kiss your butt. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If you don't want to zbe judged, don't post. We are all judged here by the quality (or lack thereof) of what we post, whether question or answer. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> No whining. If you don't like my answers, cry somewhere else. I call 'em like I see 'em. Sometimes the answer you get isn't what you want to hear, but the truth you NEED to hear. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I report spam. Posting the same question twice in the same forum is spam, and makes you a troll.

VXQCN2FEQCD7PP67A44RD7AM6E	I think America has turned so far toward socialism that it might be too late for it to turn back. I also think that American voters are the lazyist most uninformed voters in the world. They vote according what they hear cnn,abc fox,nbc and cbs the liberal networks tell them because they are too lazy and closed minded to think for themselves and because they think they know it all. but thats just my thoughts. I also think obama is bush squared, same road only worst.

VMPDASBP366RZYRI6NNH5LZSQ4	About Priscilla O'Kelly Wilkinson <br> <br/> <br> <br/> From a very early age I was always interested in interior design and decorating. I was fortunate to have been raised around artists and designers. My grandfather, Frederick E. Kelley was a designer & builder of custom log cabins in New England and my family is filled with generations of builders and artists. I apprenticed in my younger days to become an interior decorator and have decorated hundreds of private residences, commercial venues, and events over the past 19 years. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am a native of Portland, Maine but have had the wonderful opportunity to travel, live & work in many areas over the past 14 years, which only broadened my design skills. Each and every city we lived in brought new and exciting challenges with decorating. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Priscilla O'Kelly Wilkinson <br> <br/> Sanctuary Design <br> <br/> Portland, Me

If you don't care that a hispanic boy was shot in Oxnard, CA cuz he was gay, then you should go die or be shot by a gay person cuz you're straight! I don't hate heterosexuals, I just hate when they're homophobes. It's stupid. And dumb!!

Q2HFUENJLBZTXWD3J76VRRQSN4	My chief interest is Religion and Spirituality. The physical in comparison to the spiritual realm is just like the earth's crust in comparison to the entire earth; what is seen is a very small percentage compared to what is hidden from the physical. There is much more there that you can not see. The LORD is spirit & he who worships Him must worship Him in spirit & in truth. What Yahweh has shown me I seek to share with others. I believe the original writings of the Bible to be the Word of God and basically trust the King James Version, the American Standard Version, and usually the Amplified. I keep my Strong's Exhaustive Concordance within reach to check out the Greek & Hebrew. I pray & trust God for pride to not fool me, but that I can walk under a mantle of humbleness according to His enabling. He has shown me that the way to maintain clean hands and a pure heart is through humbling myself before God, by resisting self righteousness, fleeing temptation, & walking in the Spirit.

R465LYBXTF3Q3FMZDTHFAKKVSQ	I am attending High School. I am a senior and this is my last school year. I have my own plans when i finish up High School. My dad wants to move to London by 2010. Now that he wants to move there my plans are now ruined and there is nothing that i cannot do about it. I have to do everything in his own way and i know it all sucks. I cannot get my career until when i am on my own. And yes that means my driving. I cannot get what i want until my dad allows me to do so. I am already jealous about my friends, (whatever they have is what i want.) My dad will not let me to be free, he will not let me to get what i need such as my: career, driving, and he will not let me to stay in the U.S. when he has to go to London. He wants me to just do something boring such as not let me to have any friends and now i'm going to have a less-happiness life and i do not know why he still wants to take control over my life. What should i do?

RNH7DOHL7PDTCH7L5NNMKLHSGU	When I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star. The difference from me and other kids is that I wanted to be a "Secret" rock star something like the popular rock group KISS. On or off stage when in costume, I would be famous all over the world. But when not in costume, I would just mix in with the public as an ordinary kid with a private life. That way I would have the Best of Both Worlds. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Things have not changed much as an adult. Among other things I enjoy playing guitar and writing songs. So you might ask did I become a rock star. Well, I can’t tell you because it is a secret. :-) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm a member of Team Miley (our local Miley Cyrus fan club) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Other hobbies include amateur radio, genealogy, and astronomy. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I have 2 associates’ degrees from college (Avionics Technology and Computer Science). <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I live in Michigan where it is extremely cold most of the year. I can't wait for the day I win the lottery. Then I can finally move to Orlando, FL; or anywhere in Hawaii

I am currently researching behaviours of both captive and wild animals, and can help out with many common pet problems considering I have had just about every possible pet. I currently own two parrots, two cats, two rabbits, and a variety of freshwater fish including Angels, Guppies, Mollies, Corydoras, Swordtails, and the infamous Plecostomus. My parrots are Calypso, an eight month old Goffin's Cockatoo, and Kiki, an African Senegal Parrot. My cats are Tohru [Roonees], a Russian Blue female, and her daughter Little Gray Baby, a mixed breed who looks exactly like her mother's clone. My rabbits were both rescue cases, the older male Cotton [P.P. Cottontail] is a Dwarf Polish, rescued from becoming dinner, and Saphira, a female Himalayan patterned meat rabbit, who was going to be fed to a python as a public spectacle.

RAU4METLWFJEVPAJZEFMJG7YEY	(I've been activated by the Navy and am about to deploy to Iraq with 2nd Bn, 25th Marines...) Bonjour, tout le monde! My name's Michael, a 31-year-old resident of the sunny state of ... Connecticut. Exciting, I know. I currently sell insurance for a living, but I used to be a newspaper reporter for six years -- hence "Ecrivain," which means writer in French (la plus belle langue du monde). I earned a bachelor's degree in Print Journalism way back in 1999, and my minor was French. Other interesting tidbits? I serve in the U.S. Navy Reserve with the 4th Marine Division, 25th Regiment, making me a bizarre mix of sailor and marine. It's got to be the best job in the Navy, by far. I mean, how many sailors get to serve in the infantry as a bodyguard for the chaplain? That's my job. My part-time job, that is. I'm also an exotic coffee lover. Ask me about Kopi Luwak. I actually drank the stuff. Pretty good. (And it had better be, at $300 per pound!) Anyway, that's me. Ciao!

6VDJEOXZ3NWJ4E34ME6TJIGEGI	Hi there, my name's Mitchell. I'm currently 16 (as of 24/9/08) and live in Sydney, Australia. I go fairly well at school, have some great friends and have a good sense of humour. I love joking around and visiting funny websites, watching comedies, etc. I can also be a very serious person though, especially when it comes to discrimination. I personally have never been discriminated against myself, but I absolutely can't stand people who judge others on race, gender, sexuality, religion or otherwise. I like to promote tolerance, although I do tend to lack it when I'm dealing with people who discriminate (yes, ironic i know, but what can i say? I have a short temper). <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Anyway, I like reading fiction novels, playing video games (PS3), watching comedy and action movies and hanging out with friends. I spend a lot of time on the net on www.failblog.org, youtube, bebo, using stumbeupon and of course YA.

6KXN7ASWVZQNF6DIXSBXR6KA5Y	Hello folks. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm the very famous Scottish creature from Loch Ness in the Highlands. For many years folk from all over the world have tried to catch me however without success. (You'll have more chance of getting a bank loan) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> When I was born I was to be called Tuesday as my Mum had just give birth to me and turned to my Dad and said "Let's call it a day, dear" <br> <br/> <br> <br/> As I'm over 21, hard to believe I hear you cry, I thought I would help you all with my vast knowledge. Like when the experzts wonder why I went to the loo a lot, I informed them via the web that I liked curries and that it was not because I was a Megasoreass? <br> <br/> <br> <br/> So I'll put my pipe down and put on my slipper for a hour or so and help solve you humans problems. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Hopefully I will see you soon here in Scotland as I'm getting hungry again. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Haste ye back! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Love Nessie xxxx

6LGJPFPNQHXB3GFM5LHQ5ZJDDY	I'm an aspiring writer. I live down south in the US. I'm very conservative. My family has a lot of preachers. I'm very interested in politics, beauty and fashion, God, writing, dancing, singing, music, drawing, rock climbing, ice skating, four wheelers, go carts, zip lines, etc. I like collecting coins, foreign money, porcelain dolls, anything Disney, movies, Nintendo's, old lunch boxes, stamps, coca cola stuff, etc. I am a Christian, been saved, born again. I'm not one particular religion, I was raised half baptist and half pentecostal. Dad baptist preacher, mom pentecostal. Even though we all converted to baptist, I like to refer to myself as a baptacostal! Because I have mixed views and beliefs from baptist to pentecostal. I am conservative, but in some cases more liberal than most Christians. I don't think it's wrong to drink alcohol, say a few curse words, or smoke. My job isn't to find things we can't do, but to find people I can witness too. To tell people about Jesus.

UPRM3UB2REUT52PHSZTYE54TIE	I'm currently a student at a community college in California. I working on getting my AA and I'm a major in Real Estate. I'm particularly young so I tend to be inexperienced and naive, despite that, I am intelligent. I have very opinionated views on a lot of topics that throw people off, yet I'm a double-edged sword. Some days I'm bitter and short-fused, other days I'm happy, optimistic and bubbly. I can be easily misunderstood which comes with me being unable to explain myself or my actions properly. As for interests, I like anime and will be attending my second anime expo this year, no specific tastes just whatever I find that I like. I love gardening even though I have a black thumb, and when left to my own I'm very creative and imaginative. I have a passion for acting and movies leaving me to be rather analytical when watching a movie. Expressive to a fault even in public I tend to be very animated to show my emotions. There's more to me than this bu

Animals are my life and my lifelong dream is to create an animal sanctuary where rescued animals can be given a second chance at life. I consider myself to be very knowledgable concerning small animals and fish and hope to use Yahoo Answers to spread my knowlege and help people and their pets live better lives.

But I'm not a "practicing homosexual" -- I've pretty much got it down pat. And although my YA name is campy fun, I'm actually quite masculine. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> So, where did my YA name come from? Well, besides my need to maintain anonymity [I may be known to some people], "Pippi" is just campy as hell, and "Von Trapp" hints at my 25+ years working in ztheatre and film professionally. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Wouldn't it have been wacky fun if Pippi Longstocking had been adopted and become one of those damned Von Trapp tots? The others would be good little Austrians warbling "Edelweiss" up in the Alps, while she'd be the tomboyish scamp who would, say, single-handedly sets fire to the Nazis and save the world! Yay Pippi!!!

24APBOGN32ASEOULJP2VUZLAEU	I had a manager describe me once as a 'renaissance nerd' because I have extensive knowledge in engineering and the arts as well. I am a US patent holder for advancements made to power supply technology and I have been proficient enough in music to play the organ, piano, lead the choir and run all the music at church. Last year, I had a stroke from two dissected arteries in my neck which hit my medulla and brain stem caused from an accident, judo choke-out, or a chiropractor. I had only the latter risk. I lost the ability to read and play the organ & piano. My recent cognitive testing revealed my superior visual spatial abilities, ability to figure things out, and long term memory is still in tact. However, my processing speeds are slow and my ability to recall words is certifiably disabled. Since I am reading more and pushing the hours I spend on the computer to the max every day, answering questions on Yahoo is great therapy for me. I hope my experience and insight can help.

BOR3QYVID5FWMW324ETGGAHCVA	I just found out I'm expecting another baby in January 2011, and I'm already a happy stay-at-home mother of twin girls. I live in Texas with my husband of 8 years. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Our twins were conceived through IVF after 3 1/2 years of trying, Clomid rounds, failed IUIs, and a lot of testing, poking and prodding. They were born in September 2007. I learned A LOT about TTC with all the trouble we had the first time around. They never figured out what the problem was and diagnosed it as "unexplained infertility." I was over the moon when I discovered we'd managed to conceive naturally after only 4 months of trying. If anyone wants to know what worked for me or has any questions, message me any time! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am not one of those people who thinks they know everything just because I've been through a lot. I just know a lot because of what I've been through and all the research I've done throughout the process.

Acute <br> <br/> exposure to Hg vapor has been <br> <br/> shown to result in profound central <br> <br/> nervous system effects, including <br> <br/> psychotic reactions characterized by <br> <br/> delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal <br> <br/> tendency. <br> <br/> "

H6Y3XA4SLHC3SQIXHGZOBQVLCY	Bios are such self serving things, especially when you have to write them yourself. So that being the case, I will start from the beginning... <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I was born in Los Angeles on a cloudy and rainy day, I remember it well, especially that crack on the ass. Hey I guess I deserved it, my mom was crying out in all kinds of pain, so I guess I was a bad boy from second one! That's how I got the stigma of black sheep in the family. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> The next day I was taken home and put into a barrel where I was cleaned, fed, and educated through the bung hole. Again, I remember those 18 years well. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> After that they pulled the nails from the barrel, dumped a bucket of water on me and then shaved everything off and set me loose on the world, never to look back on the kindness of my upbringing. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Boy it was fortunate that I found that van down by the river with the keys in it ready to drive, otherwise I would not have had a place to live. I do wonder why that fat guy was chasing me as I was driving away though.

IM4WMXEMHD6AXAHXHN4X2Y7ENA	Hey, my name is Vie. You can usually find me in the Dog/Rodent section, but sometimes I'll answer questions from other places. As you can see, my information is pretty much open to anyone. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I can be pretty harsh with my answers at times, but I think people need to know the truth. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> BYB's are horrible. BSL is stupid. Raw meat should be used to feed dogs, but not everyone is willing, so the next best thing is a quality dog food. I believe Blue Buffalo is one of the best, and I've heard good reviews from Canidae, Wellness, and Taste of the Wild. I feed the prey model raw meat diet for my two dogs, and they LOVE it. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I own two dogs, a wolf mix and a chihuahua puppy. My dad owns an African Grey Parrot, and my brother owns a Betta fish. Within the next few months, I'll be getting my very first pair of rats. Probably male. We were going to get female, but I decided males will fit better.

IEDJXEIDLR7JSJPDFYN4UKM2S4	Hey, I am that quirky chicka that you just want to walk up to and hug ^^ then I slap you and scream at you..but you got a hug, eh? But I like my music and my art, with out them I would be lost,also I need my friends (they keep me under control,that or they help me freak out the preps in Hollister and flirt with they guy at Hot Topic ^^) But if you ever see a crazy blonde chick running down the street screaming 'The dinos are coming the dinos are coming!' then that is prolly meh. But even though I am kooky and bubbly, I also have an insanely serious side! Most people don't see that side of me, but if you look at some of the more extreme questions about serious topics, then you would never have guessed that it was me that answered it. And to add to my serious side, I also speak my mind about any topic, and don't give a damn about what others will think of me. If they have a problem with what I think or believe, then they can go die in a hole. But I have some good insight, so listen.

ICGRWC5PXXMJEFHEMFNDT2LIUA	If you asked anybody about me, they would probally say that I'm goofy and head strong. If you are my friend than I'll probally do just about anything for you, but if you make me mad I can be the meanest person you have ever met. Ever since i could remember I wanted to be a doctor and nothing will stop that. I hate people who dislike other human beings because of their race, sexual orientation, how much money they have, or religion.I just don't get why America is so obsessed with how people live their lives. Theres so much more things out there to worry about.

Otherwise, just about everything else is likable. I have a pretty good sense of humor and I'm always looking for new friends so if you are two...just maybe we should talk. I also hear I give pretty good advice(on certain subjects) so if you ever need help with something don't be afraid to ask. I find it kinda funny how I just put up the little advice thing in my "About Me" thing too but whatever. Anyways...if you're ever bored and want to talk to someone, I'm usually not doing too much so drop in sometime. If you want to know anything else about me, that would be a good excuse to talk to me too. XD

Although I do love to discuss and ponder other things like zforeign relations. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I appreciate and have begun an understanding of Zen and the philosophies that involve it. The understanding that we have more power within than we give ourselves credit for. I aim to harness all of mine. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> The way I see life is selfless. I prefer to help others as an extension of everything I do. I see helping others as not a job but something that is in my blood

L6LDCOB26LC7MXEJBA4HVNP4SQ	I'm no apologist. i've worked hard since grammar school. Top of my class in undergrad, graduate and halfway through law school. Hard work pays off. Perhaps I'll complete my J.D and sit for the bar, and perhaps I won't. I'm a Mom first and I've still got a little one to raise. Kids first. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Admittedly, I'm an elitist. I have little patience for those who think they're entitled to a free ride. I can't stand the liberal mindset. I am a PRO LIFE Conservative proud to stand for all that is moral and right. No law of man will ever supersede GOD'S law. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> We are at an all time low in America. If we don't do something substantial to get this guy OUT of there, mark my words, we WILL be attacked again. It can't be grass roots, we don't have enough time. The momentum will have to begin towards the top in order to facilitate Obama's exit. We need a President who will implement policies to correct the wrongs in this nation. We all know what they are, but it will take real courage to reverse them.

Too many bands to list but I listen to a lot of technical, brutal, and grindcore (Terrorizer, Nasum, Impetigo, Regurgitate, Repulsion, and so on). I also like some classic rock and old school gangsta rap-can't help it I grew up with that shit. I played hockey for 13 years, every position except center, I also love football(American), college basketball, MMA, baseball, and football(soccer) in that order. I like too many movies to list but some of my favorite directors are Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Stanley Kubrick and Sam Raimi's early work, and pretty much any Italian horror movie.

He had two kids from a first marriage, but they were grown when I met him. We now have six grand kids! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I enjoy cooking and reading and gardening. When I moved to Georgia, I couldn't grow Kudzu, but now I can tell the difference between Vinca and Impatiens. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I belong to the Kraftfoods web site and often get recipes from it. I also buy those little cookbooks in the checkout stand at the grocery store--you know, the ones between the horoscope books and the find-a-word. I often get recipes from friends and family, too. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I read about two or three books a week, and my favorite books are biographies. I particularly enjoy autobios and memoirs. The last one I read was "Infidel," by Ayaan Hirsi Ali. I also enjoy books about religion and science, especially the struggle between the two. I am not religious at all.

DN3F3LPHF7D4C2SVPNLSTGLLNE	ABOUT ME: <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My real name is Sonny "The Nostril" Tortellini. For 13 years I was chief enforcer and apprentice pastry chef to the notorious Grabasso crime family. I turned state's evidence last year and entered the witness protection program. The finest plastic surgeons in the world were flown in by the government to reconstruct my face, at a cost to taxpayers of 6 million dollars. For this reason I cannot post a real pic avatar: it would reveal to the Grabassos what I now look like and would be fiscally irresponsible of me. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> You probably saw my story on "Law And Order", but they changed all the details. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Only in America! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> And if you're reading this, Don Grabasso: I slept with your wife! So put that in your ravioli and smoke it!

I'm a very nice person, easy-going, and open-minded, but have very low tolerance for egotistical, ignorant, and vile-minded people.

My main concept in life is love those who love you, and never be afraid to be yourself, it is better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you are not.

A3YZJZQSC6KVO3STNNBGBWPQSI	I absolutely love animals and nature. I am against aniaml cruelty such as horse slaughter, people abusing their pets, bear farms in Asia, animal testing, zoos (including roadside zoos), aquariums, circuses, and many other places that take wild animals from their natural habitat, or harms any kind of pet or animal. <br> <br/> Also, I am against the harming of the environment. I do not like the clear-cutting of the Amazon Rainforest, global warming and greenhouse gases, poaching, or trophy hunting (and hunting in general), and many more. I think that nature and animals should be left as they were before humans caused so much damage. <br> <br/> I am currently looking for a volunteer job at a veterinary clinic. I know quite a bit about animals, the environment, and veterinary care. I think that all abuse and harm to nature and animals should be irradicated, and that everyone should think that too.

I have a love-hate relationship with my gym, but always love a good night's sleep and refreshing nature walks.

She can sit very well, pull up, and is already cruising. It scares the crap out of me! She can also say mamamamamma. Even though it is not directed to me, it melts my heart! She claps when you say "yay" and wave when you say "hi" and she also puts her hand up to her ear (as if on the phone) whenever you say "hello?" And I love it. She amazes me everyday! And keeps me sane.... <br> <br/> My husband is my best friend and the love of my life and he is in the Navy. I am a stay at home mom and I love it. I dont want to miss a thing in my daughters life. Y! answers is my way of socializing since we move around a lot. Which makes is really hard to make friends. But I am a pretty easy going person. I love to laugh and be outdoors. I am from Idaho but currently my family and I reside in California where my husband is stationed. But if you have any questions let me know!

OG63ZBQGWUGO225ZY6H4UB62RI	Overpopulation of the world is the cause of a majority of the stress we and our environment suffer from. We must start reducing the world population by encouraging smaller families. Less People is the solution to all problems. Countries like the Philippines and Bangladesh are a couple of examples of failed states because they cannot feed and take care of their own people. Countries like this need to be forced to be responsible for their ignorant ways and beliefs. These nations need to deal with their issues rather than continue to feed off the rest of the world to solve their problems.

ORAGEH2XHABQCWFDEU3YV6DFTU	I'm a tech in Silicon Valley. I consider myself to be a moderate liberal. I don't believe in communism or the free market. I am for limited levels of social programs. Immigration needs to be controlled. Markets systems need to be regulated to work efficiently. The primary role of government is to protect the rights of the individual first. We need a strong military, but it is not our job to be the worlds cops. Let the international corporations pay to secure their international assets.
